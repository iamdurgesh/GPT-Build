# GPT-BuildOverview
GPT-From-Scratch is an implementation of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model built from the ground up. Inspired by OpenAI's GPT architecture, this project aims to provide an educational and practical understanding of how transformers work, including the underlying mechanisms of attention, embedding, and language modeling. The implementation is done using PyTorch, and the project is designed to be easy to understand and extend.

Features
Transformer Architecture: Implemented with a focus on clarity and modularity.
Multi-Head Self-Attention: Supports multiple heads and layers for capturing different aspects of the data.
Positional Encoding: Implements positional encoding to give the model a sense of order.
Tokenization: Simple tokenizer for converting text to tokens and vice versa.
Training Loop: Customizable training loop with support for batching and optimization.
Fine-Tuning: Example scripts for fine-tuning the model on custom datasets.
Preprocessing: Tools for preparing and processing datasets.
